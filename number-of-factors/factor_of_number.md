input         expected output

1             the number of factors of 1 are 1
2             the number of factors of 2 are 2
3             the number of factors of 3 are 2
4             the number of factors of 4 are 3
10            the number of factors of 10 are 4
20            the number of factors of 20 are 6

// starting with what we know already

// writing the expected input and output in code


// Manually dividing with numbers from 0 to till number itself and increasing numberOfFactors by 1 everytime we found a match

// replacing magic numbers with the variables

// Using Loop to do the checking the factors and increasing the numberOfFactors .

// replacing magic numbers with the variables
