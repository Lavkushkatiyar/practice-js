input          expecations
            
153            true (1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153)
1634            true ( 1⁴ + 6⁴ + 3⁴ + 4⁴ = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634)

starting with the things we know ->

//first we will try to find out the length of inputNumber

// I realise I can do it without length means in one loop

// I was wrong for now it needs two loops;

// I converted all the magical number to variable

its done.
